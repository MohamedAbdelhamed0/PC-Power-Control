## 🛡️ Security and Antivirus Transparency

### 🚨 Understanding Antivirus Warnings

PC Power Control is a safe, open-source application. If you encounter antivirus warnings, here's what you need to know:

#### Why Do Antivirus Warnings Appear?
- New, independent software often triggers false positives
- Machine learning algorithms can incorrectly flag unfamiliar applications
- This is NOT an indication of actual malware

#### How to Safely Install

1. **Windows SmartScreen Warning**
   - Click "More Info"
   - Select "Run Anyway"

2. **Antivirus False Positive**
   - Temporarily disable real-time protection
   - Add PC Power Control to your antivirus exceptions
   - Re-enable protection after installation

### 🔍 Our Commitment to Safety
- **Open Source**: Full transparency with publicly available code
- **No Malicious Intent**: Zero hidden background processes
- **Local Network Only**: All communications remain on your local network
- **Regular Updates**: Continuously improving app signature and security

### 🤝 Need Help?
